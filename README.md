# TwitterBotScraper
Built a little scraper bot that analyzes the latest 1000 tweets on a desired search term. It uses Selenium and Chrome web driver to gather the data and returns 2 word clouds (tweets’ text &amp; associated #’s; distinguishable by their white &amp; black background color) along with a pie chart of a sentiment analysis and a table with the total number of retweets, replies and likes grouped by the sentiments (named RRL_table).
